# ListMaker
 The ListMaker code consists of a series of PHP scripts that provide both a front-end form 
 and back-end functions to collect and validate user criteria, query the Evergreen database, 
 and deliver the report in various formats to the user.  Javascript validates form entries and 
 dynamically changes the form as users make selections.  Crontab entries run reports that have been 
 designated to run periodically.
 
## What you will need

### db_info.php
The scripts will look for database connection information in a file called db_info.php which should be stored
outside the web accessible directories.  The file defines the Evergreen host, port, database name, username, and password:

```
$evergreen_host = "evergreen.yourdomain.org";
$evergreen_port = 5432;
$evergreen_database = "database_name";
$evergreen_user = "db_user_name";
$evergreen_password = "password";

$test_host = "test.yourdomain.org";
$test_port = 5432;
$test_database = "database_name";
$test_user = "db_user_name";
$test_password = "password";
```

### Custom Database Tables
If you want users to schedule reports you need a table to store the information.  We created a schema and table 
for this purpose.

```
CREATE TABLE noble.scheduled_list (
    id integer DEFAULT nextval('noble.scheduled_list_id_seq'::regclass) NOT NULL,
    library text NOT NULL,
    email text NOT NULL,
    filters text NOT NULL,
    output text NOT NULL,
    name text,
    active boolean DEFAULT true NOT NULL,
    schedule_type text,
    create_date date DEFAULT now() NOT NULL,
    weekly text,
    specific_days text,
    relative_days_of_month text,
    "interval" text,
    start_date date,
    last_run date
);
```
A cron job runs daily which checks this table for any reports that need to be run.

```
